Have a play around with the Isothermal.js Playground

https://horrelltech.github.io/Isothermal-js/

The idea behind this project is to create a javascript editing tool 
for my base game engine javascript file. it will have a playground where a person
can test code and watch the results real time and which will be
useful for quick algorithms or whipping up some code. 

A web based interface is also in the works to allow for working on 
game projects. 

Isothermal Game Framework will utilize other javascript libraries 
for rendering, physics, audio etc. The functionality of coding is aimed
to be similar to GML(Game Maker Language), so anyone who is familiar with it
will be able to just pick it up and start creating!
